# Project standards
Where reasonable, I try to follow
[Google's Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
I use `yapf` to autoformat my code, and my linter is `flake8`. The settings
for both of these tools are in `setup.cfg`. With few exceptions, all modules,
functions, methods, and attributes need docstrings and (if reasonable) unit
tests. For formatting examples, see
[this page](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html).
If you want to contribute code to this repository, make sure that you do
these things, too.
